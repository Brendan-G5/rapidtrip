# RapidTrip

RapidTrip helps you coordinating car trips with your friends. Not sure who should be travelling in whose's car in the next trip? Or which driver will be the closest one with available spots in his car? Let us do the math for you! Through our optimization algorithm, we try to pick the best car allocation, minimizing travelling times for everyone and providing a stress free trip.

## The project
This app was developed as part of a Thesis Project for a software engineer bootcamp. It divided in two apps: a client and a server.
The client is implemented in React Native for IOS and Android and the server is based on Node.js with Koa.
